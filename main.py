# To do:
#   DONE: Restaurant selector in add menu (just pass all current restaurants)
#   DONE: Better view menu page
#   DONE: Test to see if you can update restaurant info
#   DONE: Move errors to seperate structure
#   DONE: Implement efficient queries:
#   DONE: Fix dietary restriction; not uploading (fixed I think)
#
#   DONE: UPDATE DATABASE
    #       Menu-Verisons should point to restuarant ID not menu_id
    #       There will never be two menus with the same menu_id so its compleltey pointless right now.
#       
#   DONE: API endpoint for view.html; live updates for deletion 
#           impossible without some crazy shit: and processing PDFs

#   Filters!!
# Versions arent deleting?
